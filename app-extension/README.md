# Install

```bash
quasar ext add easy-tables
quasar ext add easy-forms # peer dependency
```
Quasar CLI will retrieve it from NPM and install the extension.

You can then use the `<EasyTable />` component out of the box.

## Prompts

> If your app extension uses prompts, explain them here, otherwise remove this section.

# Uninstall
```bash
quasar ext remove easy-tables
```

# Info
> Add longer information here that will help the user of your app extension.
